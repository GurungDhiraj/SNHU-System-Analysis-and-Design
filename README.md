# SNHU-System-Analysis-and-Design

## <ins>**Course Description:**<ins>

Students will explore the principles, methods, and techniques used in systems development so that they can create system models using appropriate industry tools. As a part of creating system models, students will also learn to effectively communicate technical concepts and design decisions to various audiences in a professional manner.

## <ins>**Course Competencies:**<ins>

This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills relevant to your field:

    •CS-30404: Explain the principles, methods, and techniques of systems development
    •CS-30405: Create various system models through the application of appropriate tools
    •COM-20257: Present and articulate technical concepts to nontechnical audiences


## <ins>**Questions:**<ins>
- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client?
    -	DriverPass is a company that wants to create a learning management system for students applying for their driving license exam. They want users to be able to take practice tests online, book in-person driving training online, have different training packages, and allow students to keep track of their own personal progress. There were more requirements that DriverPass wanted for this project.
      
- What type of system did they want you to design?
    - My job in this project was creating a business requirements document, a model application paper, and a system design document. These documents would be lay the foundation for the development team to get started developing and coding the learning management system for DriverPass.

- What did you do particularly well?
    - For the business requirements document, there are a number of things I did well on, based on the feedback from my professor. Firstly, I created a Gantt chart that included a realistic schedule. I also described the interface requirements well, and I had clear communication throughout the paper. For the system design document, I used proper Unified Modeling Language notations for my diagrams, and I had clear communication throughout the document.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick?
    - There were also things I didn’t do so well on, like the activity diagrams could have been improved. I needed to add logic to both activity diagrams such that the user did not have an unlimited number of attempts to try their login information.

- How would you improve it?
    - If I were to design the system again, I would add a limit of 5 login attempts before the account is locked, and the user needs to verify themselves via email before trying to log in again.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design?
    - I interpreted the user’s different needs by trying to keep practicality in mind. For example, the user may forget their password at some point. That is why most sites and applications that require you to log in have a feature to allow you to change your password. There are also other design features that need to be implemented, like an intuitive user interface, so that users of all different skill levels can navigate the system easily.

- Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    - It is important to keep the user’s needs in mind when creating the system design because it is ultimately the user who will be using the system on a daily basis. As a result, the system should be easily navigable by the user. Additionally, DriverPass will make more money as more users join and use their system. However, if the user has difficulty navigating the system, they may not be able to book any packages or may stop using the system altogether. Both of these outcomes would be bad for our client, DriverPass.

- How do you approach designing software? 
    - In designing software, it is important to keep the security of the system and its usability in mind. Firstly, security is important when dealing with different login details and monetary transactions. If the accounts are not secure and data gets leaked, thieves may steal the customer’s login details and their credit card information, which could do a lot of damage to the customer. However, it is also important to make sure that the user interface is simple and easy to navigate, so that users of all skill levels can find their way through the menus.

- What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    - One technique that I would use in the future is to imagine that I am the user and try navigating the system as if I were the user. Doing mock navigations of the system can help reveal if I missed any important features within my design. Additionally, I will try to think about the different requirements that are needed in the system. Ensuring that each requirement was met was quite helpful in creating a thorough design.

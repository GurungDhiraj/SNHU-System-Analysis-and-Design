# SNHU-System-Analysis-and-Design

## <ins>**Course Description:**<ins>

Students will create realistic, interactive, three-dimensional objects through the use of application programming interface (API) libraries and best practices. Students will also develop fully formed graphic applications that meet project requirements.

## <ins>**Course Competencies:**<ins>

This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills relevant to your field:

    •CS-30418: Generate accurate representations of three-dimensional objects using application programming interface libraries and computer graphics development best practices
    •CS-30419: Create interactive graphics applications that respond to input devices
    •CS-30420: Develop a fully formed three-dimensional project that meets project requirements

## <ins>**Questions:**<ins>
•	How do I approach designing software?
o	My approach to software design is a bit structured and methodical. I like to create a checklist of the things I need to do before I write the code to implement it in a scene. I used my checklist as a guide for what I should work on during that time.
•	What new design skills have your work on the project helped you to craft?
o	While working on this project, I learned how to render shapes and implement the different features like textures and lighting to make the shapes more realistic. I learned about the Phong lighting technique and how there are different types of lighting that are important to consider when adding realism to a scene.
•	What design process did you follow for your project work?
o	The design process that I used for this project was to work on different sections of the project each week. In order to create the final project, I focused on a different section of the main project each week. This helped reduce the stress as I never felt like I had to complete the project in one sitting. Instead, each week I only had to focus on one part of the project. As I made progress each week, I had pretty much completed the project before the deadline, and I only had to add finishing touches in the last week.
•	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
o	I believe this approach of breaking the project down into smaller chunks is quite useful because it helps provide a structure for what I need to learn and do each week. This is one strategy that I will be bringing into any future projects I want to work on. There were a lot of things I did not know how to do when I first started the project. However, if I had tried to learn it all at once without any structure, I would have been overwhelmed and very stressed out. Working on the project in chunks gave me a chance to focus on a specific section each week, while not having to worry about the rest of the project. While this may be counterintuitive, not having to worry about the whole project actually made me work more effectively.
•	How do I approach developing programs?
o	My approach to developing the programs and designing the software is quite similar. I always start with a plan and a checklist. I create a plan of things I want to achieve, then I try to use that as a guide for the work I need to do. This plan may change as I work on the project because I learn something new or because I may not have enough time to implement something I wanted to do today. However, I do stick with the plan and use it to guide my work.
•	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
o	When working on the 3D scene, I used a lot more object-oriented techniques, like creating methods in a class so that the functions were reusable by other parts of the program. I also tried to make modular code, which resulted in me writing more functions, but it allowed my code to be more organized and readable.
•	How did iteration factor into your development?
o	Each week, I was working on something new each week, and getting feedback on last week’s work from my professor. This allowed me to make adjustments to my code on a weekly basis, and then I would work on a new section of code. The beginning of each week would serve as a way for me to review last week's code and make changes as needed.
•	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones that led you to the project’s completion?
o	As I worked on the code throughout the milestones, I learned new techniques and gained more experience. I would use the experience to go back on the old code and better optimize it each week. For example, I realized that the way I was adjusting the position of the shapes in week 1 was inefficient if I wanted to move more complex shapes. As a result, I added an offset vector in the code so that I could move all of the complex shapes in one object simply by adjusting one line of code. As I learned more and had more experience working on the project, I was more comfortable with trying to make adjustments and fixing errors that popped up.
•	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o	My goal is to become a software engineer, and learning the fundamentals of computer science is crucial in becoming a better software engineer. I need to have the knowledge and skills to code if I want to work as a software engineer.
•	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
o	The knowledge and skills I learned working with rendering the scenes have helped me learn the basics of how to render objects in a 3D world. There is still much I need to learn before I can start animating the objects, but if I choose to pursue animation in the future, this knowledge will serve as a foundation for how to animate.
•	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
o	While the rendered scene shows artistically how the objects look, the actual work behind the scenes is about the math it takes to create such shapes and how to adjust their positions. Knowing conceptually what math was used to create these vectors and shapes is a translatable skill, especially if I work in a field that requires rendering 3D scenes. There is also a lot of optimization happening behind the scenes to ensure that the computer can handle rendering the given scene.
